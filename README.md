## About Me
# Hi, I'm Kelsey! I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for building and producing scalable software solutions that cater to both the user and functionality from conception to deployment. With 2 years of engineering experience along with seven years experience in customer support and sales, I have a strong foundation in driving result oriented solutions, project management, communication, and adaptability in fast paced environments. In addition to my professional work experience, I developed my discipline, strong work ethic, and resilience from my fifteen years of classical ballet training and my three years as a professional ballet dancer. I am a hard-working, detail oriented, reliable team player with strong analytical and interpersonal skills, who strives while working in young, dynamic environments with like-minded individuals.
